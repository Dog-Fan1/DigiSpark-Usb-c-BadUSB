# DigiSpark-Usb-c-BadUSB

**This is a hobby project for ethical use only.**

The DigiSpark is a development board with HID USB-C capabilities. 
It is the cheaper alternative for a BadUSB or a USB Rubber Ducky/Bunny.
My curiosity piqued, I am developing this project so that the board can connect to this project (thanks to render.com (not paid promotion)), and can now curl the site and store data from the connected device.
